  <p>Korea, Malaysia, and now Hong Kong. From 10 different subjects in O Levels, to 4 pre-business in A Levels, to a Bachelor's in Economics & Finance and a Minor in Politics, to a career in digital marketing. I clearly needed time to settle on something and now I really have.</p>
  <p>I believe in creating a user-centered digital experience. This means that anyone at any point of contact must be served the content that answers their questions, the ad that is most relevant to them, the platform that is usable and enjoyable... It's the UX approach to marketing.</p>
  <p>During my transition between jobs, I've been catching up with my to-read list, digging into how the Internet infrastructure works, and creating an online course on Naver PPC. Find the course "Start Advertising in Korea with Naver PPC" on Udemy and let me know your feedback if you enroll!</p>
